# Knowledge Distillation for Optimized_brain_tumor_detection 
Welcome to the Knowledge Distillation for Image Classification repository! This project demonstrates the application of knowledge distillation, where a large, powerful teacher model (ResNet101) transfers its knowledge to a smaller, student model (custom CNN), making it more efficient while retaining high performance.
